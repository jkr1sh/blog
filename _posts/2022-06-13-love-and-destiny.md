title: On Love and Destiny
---

>Santiago also considers the merchant’s daughter, but reflects that she does not depend on him like his sheep do, and perhaps she doesn't even remember him......The boy feels jealous of the wind that is blowing because it is free, but he realizes that there is nothing to hold him back from pursuing his dream, and from having the same freedom.

Till this point Santiago refused from realizing that the merchant's daughter liking him back was a total pipe dream, now he is just being more realistic about her, and by doing so he allows the greater pull of his treasure to guide him.

It's made so stupidly clear that no matter what your situation is there is always the freedom to pursue a dream, letting go of all inhibitions holding you back.

>“In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to read the omens that he left for you.”

Sometime he fucks up too, or perhaps you fail to see what the omen actually means, when the universe *winks* at you, stay skeptical only then can you see an omen for what it truly is, good or bad or totally soul crushing...

>“You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his destiny. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it wasn’t true love… the love that speaks the Language of the World.”

I haven't found my Fatima yet...but it's time to let go of the merchant's daughter and go forth to seek the soul of the world.

There is a rightness to pursuing one's own legend no matter how hard it gets, it's inarguably the most important choice you and I have to make, yet when it comes to making that choice people fuck up so bad, cause they are blinded by supposedly good things in life like love or not so good things like fear or anxiety of the outcome of embarking on this journey. One thing or the other gets in the way of you pursuing your personal legend, but you have to let go of it by understanding the complete unimportance of fear and death in this journey and only focus on the connection you have with the soul of the world.

You must also realize that your life improves and you start seeing the value of living through the purpose and engagement that the pursuit of your personal legend gives you everyday.
