title: first day of school
---

Today was my **first** day at NPS, It is my first time ever being the new student, and I gotta say even though I am not much of a social animal, I had a pretty good time.

In my opinion(ehhh...that's what this entire blog is) All my subject teachers seemed really experienced and exuded a deep passion for teaching. They all felt really approachable as well.

For some reason, My class teacher reminds me of my vice-principal at PSBN...

Shifting the focus from the teachers, I did this totally embarassing thing today, The Class teacher was calling out the time-table f0r the day and said: "The first block is of Bio and CS". My genius ass blurted out, "Is it the Bio block and then the CS block or otherwise?" expectadly she had a jolly good laugh about it, the class joined in and I joined in as well. What I realised in that fraction of a moment is to let your ego f### right off and learn to laugh at yourself cause life's too short to not enjoy these silly little moments.

Most of the guys seemed cool, there is this girl whose name I couldn't prononuce for the life of me and once I finally got it in the last period, it def called for celebration.

One thing I realised from today, I am not some anti-social freak as I painted myself up in my head, I managed to talk to people I've never even seen before in my life and hold convos without it becoming too awkward (atleast that's what I think), but what that means is that I no longer fit the trop of some misunderstood-secretly saving the world-protagonist and that's prolly for the better, Much rather crack JEE than save the world!!!(not totally joking...)

I gave out my insta today which means there's significant chance that people from my class are gonna end up here, in that case, hiiii let me know in school or I can be your secret no worries :)
