>Two days down; two more years to go...

Had my first two days of classes, it was certainly a throwback to the 8th Grade, cause of the in-person classes, actualy made me pay attention and is way more effective.

Something I noticed in math class, everybody seems to be much faster than me...I have no problem understanding what's being done in class but there were certainly times in the last two days itself when right after the "concept" was discussed and sample problems were put up on the board, and, alot of the students were incredibly fast in responding to those questions and even had clever tricks to simplify the problem.

My honest deduction after observing this happen a couple times is that, they already fucking know the concept...No this not my ego talking, I even saw a dude with a copy of personal notes for the chemistry class before the class had fucking begun.

Don't get me wrong, this is not me hating...More power to them, It just shows how behind I already am...

The last two years of doing nothing is the major culprit to this tiny disconnect I am feeling in class, I just have to put in more work to overcome this.

I'm also not going to write every week, that was such an absurd idea. I'll make a post when I have something to say.
