title: last day of summer break
---

**18;27**

Should have started writing this earlier today, but hey, We are starting now. I have to head to the gym now, starting on a new workout routine, will continue writing as soon as I come back.

**19;58**

finished working out at 19;30, the new routine took time to figure out, had me at the gym for 60min, gotta make it fit in 20-30min.

Anyway let's get to it, today is the last day of summer break. From tommorow it's gonna be full steam ahead for the next *2 years*. Put in all the work that is humanly possible to get a *sub-200* AIR in JEE Mains & Advanced.

The subjects that I have are:
- Physics
- Chemistry
- Math
- Computer Science

*Prolly English too*

I've decided to take this incredibly diehard combination of NPS+ALLEN to make sure my head is in the game at all times.

I am going to set aside 30 minutes every friday after coming back from ALLEN every week for writing a post for this blog. Could be general updates, musings that I have noted down throughout that week or stories from my past.

I don't really think very many people are going to be reading this blog but to those that end up here in my little place in the interwebs, leave a [message](https://jkr1sh.github.io/blog/contact.html) *you can even do it anonymously*. I'd find that to be really cool :)

I am going to read*(I'm halfway through 'Why we Sleep?' by Matthew Walker)* for a while now and then head to bed, gotta get my sleep to fit in my routine too. Oh yeah I will prolly also write a post about my routine once I get it dialed in.
